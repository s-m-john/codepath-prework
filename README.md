## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: Notes
Easy to use
Ordered by previous 7 Days, 30 Days and then months

App: Slack
Workspaces are ordered and it is easy to swipe through to see what's new
Control notifications

App: DuoLingo
A new favorite because it easy to use
Makes learning fun and accessible.

An app that I would like to work on is a Geography Quiz App that tests users on States and their capitals and another level would; be international testing for countries and their capitals using RestCountries API. I think this would be a great project for K-12 students or anyone interested in brushing up on their knowledge. One feature would be team quizzes where groups can compete to see who answers the most correctly in a certain time.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I am familiar with GitHub but I don't use GitHub Desktop so what have taken minutes to complete took me much longer to troubleshoot. I'm not sure what went wrong but I was eventually able to fix it.

Also running the app an encountering a blank screen.

My code:

//
//  AppDelegate.swift
//  prework
//
//  Created by Sophia  on 8/20/23.
//

import UIKit

@main internal class AppDelegate : UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    internal func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]?) -> Bool

    internal func application(_ application: UIApplication, configurationForConnecting connectingSceneSession: UISceneSession, options: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) -> UISceneConfiguration

    internal func application(_ application: UIApplication, didDiscardSceneSessions sceneSessions: Set<UISceneSession>)
}
